Gitano is a project related to work on the gypsy moth.  Here we are using genetic algorithms to evolve asymmetry in [Population Graphs](http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu/tag/population-graphs/) more to be able to uncover localized directional gene flow.  This is being written in C and Swift and can be found on my github site at: [http://github.com/dyerlab/gitano](http://github.com/dyerlab/gitano).  If you'd like to contribute, feel free to email [me](mailto:rjdyer@vcu.edu) about it.
