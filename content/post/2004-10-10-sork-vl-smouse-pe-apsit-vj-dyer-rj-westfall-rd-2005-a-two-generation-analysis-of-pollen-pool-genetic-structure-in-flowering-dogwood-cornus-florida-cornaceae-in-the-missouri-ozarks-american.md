Sork VL, Smouse PE, Apsit VJ, Dyer RJ, Westfall RD. 2005. A two-generation analysis of pollen pool genetic structure in flowering dogwood, Cornus florida (Cornaceae), in the Missouri Ozarks. <i>American Journal of Botany*, <i>*92**, 262-271.
Anthropogenic landscape change can disrupt gene flow. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, this study examined whether silvicultural practices influence pollen-mediated gene movement in the insect-pollinated species, <i>Cornus florida</i> L., by comparing pollen pool structure (Φst) among clear-cutting, selective cutting, and uncut regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings—10 each from 150 seed parents (43 in clear-cut, 74 in selective, and 33 in control sites) from six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha), eight allozyme loci were analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as TWOGENER (Smouse et al., 2001; Evolution 55: 260–271). This analysis revealed that pollen pool structure was less in clear-cut (Φ<sub>C</sub>= 0.090, P < 0.001) than in uncut areas (Φ<sub>U</sub>= 0.174, P < 0.001), with selective-cut intermediate (Φ<sub>S</sub>= 0.125, P < 0.001). These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N<sub>ep</sub>) in clear-cut (N<sub>ep</sub>= 5.56) and selective-cut (N<sub>ep</sub>= 4.00) areas than in uncut areas (N<sub>ep</sub>= 2.87). We demonstrate that Φ<sub>C</sub> ≤ Φ<sub>S</sub> ≤ Φ<sub>U</sub>, with Φ<sub>C</sub>significantly smaller than Φ<sub>U</sub> (P < 0.034). The findings imply that, as long as a sufficiently large number of seed parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic bottleneck in the effective number of mothers, silvicultural management may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents, and hence subsequent genetic diversity in <i>Cornus florida*.
