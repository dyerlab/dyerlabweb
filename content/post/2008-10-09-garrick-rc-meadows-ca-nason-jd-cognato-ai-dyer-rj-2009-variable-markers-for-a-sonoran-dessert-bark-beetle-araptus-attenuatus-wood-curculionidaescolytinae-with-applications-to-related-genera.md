## Abstract
We report eight new co-dominant nuclear markers for population genetics of the bark beetle <i>Araptus attenuatus</i> Wood. Several loci include introns from low- copy genes, and four cross-amplify in one or more related genera. The markers show moderate levels of polymorphism (2–19 alleles per locus), and no loci showed significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg or linkage equilibrium across both of the two populations examined, consistent with Mendelian inheritance patterns.
