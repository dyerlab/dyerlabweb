This semester has a ton of new content and opportunities in the Dyerlab. Here is a quick synopsis.*Teaching 
Population Genetics, should be a ton of fun.
	
*Teaching the Distributed graduate seminar 
Landscape Genetics again.
	
*Starting a new eDNA project with VDOT and getting a new student associated with it.
	
*Starting a new RadSEQ project on Protonotary Warblers and getting a new student to start in the fall.
	
*Starting a new Landscape Genetics NSF-funded project on gypsy moths with the Johnson Lab.  Need a technician for this one as well.
	
*The text 
Applied Population Genetics should be released as an ebook.
	
*Should be finishing up both Jameson’s and Chitra’s theses and submitting them for publication.
	
*Moving into a new laboratory location and perhaps collapsing both our lab and the Verrelli lab into a single unit.
