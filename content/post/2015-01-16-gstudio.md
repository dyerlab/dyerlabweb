This is the main package that provides data types and routines for spatial analysis of genetic marker data. The previous version is currently available on 
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) and you can install it rom within your R environtment by invoking the command
install.packages("gstudio")
If you want to keep up with the latest developments of this package, you can use the version found on GitHub.  Install it from within R as:
require(devtools)
install_github("dyerlab/gstudio")
and that should get you up-to-date.  You'll need to have a fully working LaTeX install and some other stuff to build it if you fork.
The Users Manual for the package with several examples can be found 
[here](http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/)
I have started a github account for this package, you can get access to the whole codebase read about it on the wiki, and contribute to the project from its repo at 
[https://github.com/dyerlab](http://github.com/dyerlab).
