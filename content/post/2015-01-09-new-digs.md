There are several reasons why I am doing this:
*I don't seem to update too often if I hand code it making my lab webpage rather stale.
    
*Syndication and federation of posts can add dynamic content from lab members to the site.
    
*I'm moving towards this approach in teaching as well so I thought I would eat 
[my own dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).
We will see how it goes.  Lots of stuff to add and go over.
