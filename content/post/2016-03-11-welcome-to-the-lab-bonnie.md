As part of a collaboration with VDOT, I am pleased to announce that 
[Ms. Bonnie Roderique](http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu/people/) has just joined the Dyer laboratory to work on a project around the endangered James River Spinymussel (
Pleurobema collina). Â Not a plant, but at least not a vertebrate!
