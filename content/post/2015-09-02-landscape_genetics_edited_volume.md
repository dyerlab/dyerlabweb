The edited volume of texts on Landscape Genetics is in the pipeline. It can be found on the Wiley & Sons [website](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118525299.html). This is part of the text that we are going to use in teaching the Landscape Genetics Distributed Graduate Seminar.
There are two chapters that were contributed to:
- Graph theory and network models in landscape genetics by Murphy, Cushman, and Dyer
- Landscape and plant population genetics by Dyer.
