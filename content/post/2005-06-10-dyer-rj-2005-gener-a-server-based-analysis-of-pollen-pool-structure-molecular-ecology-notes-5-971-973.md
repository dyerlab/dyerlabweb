Dyer RJ. 2005. Gener: a server-based analysis of pollen pool structure. <i>Molecular Ecology Note*s, <i>*5**, 971-973.
## Abstract
The server-based program GENER performs the two-generation analysis of pollen flow for data consisting of mother/offspring arrays using genetic markers. The GENER program decomposes the genetic variance sampled by maternal individuals within and among pollen pool components of genetic variance and is accessible from http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu. These estimates are used to construct the test statistic, Φ~ft~, whose significance is tested via permutation. The Φ~ft~ statistic can subsequently be used to quantify genetic effective pollen donor population size (N~ep~), effective mating area and dispersal distance. Furthermore, the GENER program can calculate Φ~ft~ values for all pairs of substrata within the data set.
