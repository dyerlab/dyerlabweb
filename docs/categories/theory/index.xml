      <title>Applied Population Genetics Textbook Release</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be posting portions of all 10 chapters of my upcoming textbook, Applied Population Genetics, as early draft chapters to this website over the spring semester.
This book will be published in both ibook and print-on-demand versions. I prefer the ibook format because I can embed interactive content (movies, JavaScript, etc.) into the text and it will update automatically when I make revisions etc.
The drawback is that ibook is limited to OSX and iOS devices at this timeâ€”which is why I will also be making it available as a print-on-demand text (though the interactive content will not obviously be included). The complete text is scheduled to be made available by the end of the academic year and I will be using it as the primary source in my Spring courses of Population Genetics BIOL516 and Landscape Genetics ENVS 692&lt;/p&gt;
