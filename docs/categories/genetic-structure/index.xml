      <title>Applied Population Genetics Textbook Release</title>
      <link>http://dyerlab/2015/12/applied-population-genetics-textbook-release/</link>

      <guid>http://dyerlab/2015/12/applied-population-genetics-textbook-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be posting portions of all 10 chapters of my upcoming textbook, Applied Population Genetics, as early draft chapters to this website over the spring semester.
This book will be published in both ibook and print-on-demand versions. I prefer the ibook format because I can embed interactive content (movies, JavaScript, etc.) into the text and it will update automatically when I make revisions etc.
The drawback is that ibook is limited to OSX and iOS devices at this timeâ€”which is why I will also be making it available as a print-on-demand text (though the interactive content will not obviously be included). The complete text is scheduled to be made available by the end of the academic year and I will be using it as the primary source in my Spring courses of Population Genetics BIOL516 and Landscape Genetics ENVS 692&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methylation Structure</title>
      <link>http://dyerlab/2015/09/methylation-structure/</link>

      <guid>http://dyerlab/2015/09/methylation-structure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is some interesting data coming out of the Baja
Araptus attenuatus project.  We looked at methylation variation, localized within the genome and compared the amount of among-population variation present.  The underlying idea here is that in insects, methylation is more often encountered in coding regions, and has been shown in many cases to be influencing phenotype.
moreSo, the questions we are looking at are:*Is there spatial genetic variation in the methylation &amp;lsquo;loci&amp;rsquo;?  If not, methylation may not be useful in the search for adaptive variance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*If there is variation, does it mimic the spatial structure found in nucleotide-based markers?
*If some fraction of methylation loci, say
p, do contain spatial structure then it means that these methylation patterns are inherited and can be used to help reconstruct neutral history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The rest of the methylation structure, say
1-p, can be considered as being due to processes that operate at a time scale that does not capture recent demographic processes.  These would be the ones we are most interested in looking at for evidence of local adaptation, right?
So in the first step, how is the variation distributed amongst populations in the nucleotide markers and their paired methylation markers can be seen below.

If we look at genetic distances between population for both sets of markers, we see a discongruence in the topological structure.  Here is a tangle plot of the data, on the left are the nucleotide markers and on the right are the methylation ones.  The red branches in the interior of each are those that are different between the two topologies.

      <title>GStudio: An R Package for Spatial Analysis of Marker Data</title>
      <link>http://dyerlab/2015/01/gstudio-an-r-package-for-spatial-analysis-of-marker-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dyerlab/2015/01/gstudio-an-r-package-for-spatial-analysis-of-marker-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the main package that provides data types and routines for spatial analysis of genetic marker data. The previous version is currently available on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; and you can install it rom within your R environtment by invoking the command
install.packages(&amp;ldquo;gstudio&amp;rdquo;)
If you want to keep up with the latest developments of this package, you can use the version found on GitHub.  Install it from within R as:
require(devtools)
install_github(&amp;ldquo;dyerlab/gstudio&amp;rdquo;)
and that should get you up-to-date.  You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a fully working LaTeX install and some other stuff to build it if you fork.
The Users Manual for the package with several examples can be found
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
I have started a github account for this package, you can get access to the whole codebase read about it on the wiki, and contribute to the project from its repo at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/dyerlab&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dyerlab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
