      <title>Applied Population Genetics Textbook Release</title>
      <link>http://dyerlab/2015/12/applied-population-genetics-textbook-release/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be posting portions of all 10 chapters of my upcoming textbook, Applied Population Genetics, as early draft chapters to this website over the spring semester.
This book will be published in both ibook and print-on-demand versions. I prefer the ibook format because I can embed interactive content (movies, JavaScript, etc.) into the text and it will update automatically when I make revisions etc.
The drawback is that ibook is limited to OSX and iOS devices at this timeâ€”which is why I will also be making it available as a print-on-demand text (though the interactive content will not obviously be included). The complete text is scheduled to be made available by the end of the academic year and I will be using it as the primary source in my Spring courses of Population Genetics BIOL516 and Landscape Genetics ENVS 692&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GStudio: An R Package for Spatial Analysis of Marker Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the main package that provides data types and routines for spatial analysis of genetic marker data. The previous version is currently available on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; and you can install it rom within your R environtment by invoking the command
install.packages(&amp;ldquo;gstudio&amp;rdquo;)
If you want to keep up with the latest developments of this package, you can use the version found on GitHub.  Install it from within R as:
require(devtools)
install_github(&amp;ldquo;dyerlab/gstudio&amp;rdquo;)
and that should get you up-to-date.  You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a fully working LaTeX install and some other stuff to build it if you fork.
The Users Manual for the package with several examples can be found
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
I have started a github account for this package, you can get access to the whole codebase read about it on the wiki, and contribute to the project from its repo at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/dyerlab&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dyerlab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
