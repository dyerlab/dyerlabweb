	Abstract = {{For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary, it must satisfy two
   conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing
   disciplines, and it must be able to provide insights, through this
   interaction, that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this
   study, I examine the complete body of peer-reviewed literature
   self-identified as landscape genetics (LG) using the statistical
   approaches of text mining and natural language processing. The goal here
   was to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in LG studies,
   the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they
   are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology
   and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within
   published LG studies examining the extent to which emergent questions
   are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing
   individual- and population-based approaches. I close by providing some
   suggestions on where theoretical and analytical work is needed if LGs is
   to serve as a real bridge connecting evolution and ecology sensu lato.}},

	Abstract = {{At the heart of the analyses of landscape genetics are isolation models
   seeking to explain either interindividual or interpopulation
   connectivity. These models use spatial, ecological, and topographic
   predictor variables measured between sites in an attempt to explain
   observed genetic variation. During the past decade, these models have
   adopted an increasingly sophisticated set of techniques to quantify
   intervening physical and ecological spaces, although they are restrained
   by rather mundane approaches to characterizing the genetic components of
   connectivity. Population Graphs are one approach to improving the
   quantification of genetic covariance used in models of landscape
   genetics. I explain the construction of the Population Graph framework,
   explain its strengths and weaknesses, and provide examples of how it has
   been used during the past decade within the contexts of landscape and
   population genetics.}},

	Abstract = {{Pollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure
   in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and
   site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived
   attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important
   role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of
   landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the
   effects of interindividual distance using spatial and increasingly
   ecological separation, yet have not incorporated individual plant
   characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially
   explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion
   of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the
   statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon
   examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site
   characteristics provided better models than those that only considered
   interindividual spatial distance (e.g. IBD). Models parameterized using
   conditional genetic covariance (e.g. population graphs) also
   outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus
   florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site
   characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal
   tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better
   models describing gene flow than models including only between-site
   spatial (IBD) and ecological (isolation by resistance) variables.
   Overall, our results show that including interindividual and local
   ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level
   measures of contemporary gene flow.}},

   Cooperation project (FoResTTraC, http://www.foresttrac.eu/) sponsored a
   workshop in August 2010 to evaluate the potential for using a landscape
   genomics approach for studying plant adaptation to the environment and
   the potential of local populations for coping with changing climate.
   This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we
   believe forest trees offer an unparalleled opportunity to address
   fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of
   landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic
   approaches that provide critical information needed for natural resource
   management. In this paper, we will cover four topics. First, we begin by
   defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation
   for tree species in the application of this approach toward
   understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review
   traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation
   and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we
   present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic
   analyses. Finally, we briefly touch on how these approaches can aid in
   understanding practical topics such as management of tree populations

	Abstract = {{Ecologically interacting species may have phylogeographical histories
   that are shaped both by features of their abiotic landscape and by
   biotic constraints imposed by their coassociation. The Baja California
   peninsula provides an excellent opportunity to examine the influence of
   abiotic vs. biotic factors on patterns of diversity in plant-insect
   species. This is because past climatic and geological changes impacted
   the genetic structure of plants quite differently to that of
   codistributed free-living animals (e.g. herpetofauna and small mammals).
   Thus, plant-like' patterns should be discernible in host-specific insect
   herbivores. Here, we investigate the population history of a monophagous
   bark beetle, Araptus attenuatus, and consider drivers of
   phylogeographical patterns in the light of previous work on its host
   plant, Euphorbia lomelii. Using a combination of phylogenetic,
   coalescent-simulation-based and exploratory analyses of mitochondrial
   DNA sequences and nuclear genotypic data, we found that the evolutionary
   history of A.attenuatus exhibits similarities to its host plant that are
   attributable to both biotic and abiotic processes. Southward range
   expansion and recent colonization of continental Sonora from the Baja
   peninsula appear to be unique to this taxon pair and probably reflect
   influences of the host plant. On the other hand, abiotic factors with
   landscape-level influences on a diverse suite of codistributed
   arid-adapted taxa, such as Plio- and Pleistocene-aged marine incursions
   in the region, also left genetic signatures in beetle and host plant
   populations. Superimposed on these similarities, bark beetle-specific
   patterns and processes were also evident: our data revealed two
   secondarily sympatric, reproductively isolated genetic lineages, as well
   as a previously unrecognized mid-peninsular warm desert refuge. Taken
   together, this work illustrates that the evolutionary history of
   species-specific insect herbivores may represent a mosaic of influences,
   includingbut not limited tothose imposed by the host plant.}},

	Abstract = {{Whether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the
   spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a
   landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The
   tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped
   onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The
   characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which
   is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and
   thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e.
   metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its
   distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective
   pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus
   be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant
   populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of
   attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative
   genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species.
   What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the
   first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us
   closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive
   phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta

	Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and landscape topology may influence the genetic
   structure and connectivity between natural populations. Six
   microsatellite loci were used to infer the population structure of 35
   populations (N = 788) of the alpine Arabian burnet moth Reissita simonyi
   (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae) in Yemen and Oman. Due to the patchy
   distribution of larval food plants, R. simonyi is not continuously
   distributed throughout the studied area and the two recognized
   subspecies of this endemic species (Reissita s. simonyi/R. s.
   yemenicola) are apparently discretely distributed. All microsatellites
   showed prevalence of null alleles and therefore a thorough investigation
   of the impact of null alleles on different population genetic parameters
   (F-ST, inbreeding coefficients, and Population Graph topologies) is
   given. In general, null alleles reduced genetic covariance and
   independence of allele frequencies resulting in a more connected genetic
   topology in Population Graphs and an overestimation of pairwise F-ST
   values and inbreeding coefficients. Despite the presence of null
   alleles, Population Graphs also showed a much higher genetic
   connectivity within subspecies (and lower genetic differentiation (via
   F-ST)) than between; supporting existing taxonomic distinction. Partial
   Mantel tests showed that both geographical distance and altitude were
   highly correlated with the observed distribution of genetic structure
   within R. simonyi. In conclusion, we identified geographical and
   altitudinal distances in R. simonyi as well as an intervening desert
   area to be the main factors for spatial genetic structure in this
   species and show that the taxonomic division into two subspecies is
   confirmed by genetic analysis.}},

	Abstract = {{The manner by which pollinators move across a landscape and their
   resulting preferences and/or avoidances of travel through particular
   habitat types can have a significant impact on plant population genetic
   structure and population-level connectivity. We examined the spatial
   genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae)
   adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two
   mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic
   covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident
   adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively
   autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of
   restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small
   (s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) =
   0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open
   canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced
   by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial
   distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was
   quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a
   network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance.
   The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive
   relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through
   C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy
   (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy),
   and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species
   cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within
   stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations
   are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and
   quality of intervening canopy cover.}},

	Abstract = {{Patterns of spatial genetic structure produced following the expansion
   of an invasive species into novel habitats reflect demographic processes
   that have shaped the genetic structure we see today. We examined 359
   individuals from 23 populations over 370 km within the James River Basin
   of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin.
   Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using
   several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for
   three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two
   distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the
   basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system
   advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found
   suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However,
   surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations
   suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive
   species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may
   provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead
   to better management strategies for control and eradication.}},

	Abstract = {{Landscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how
   site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation
   and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this
   manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape
   genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived
   from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially
   confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic
   history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based
   simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of
   genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic
   distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional
   stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance
   D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract
   the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape
   genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert
   succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed
   phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii,
   removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences
   our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of
   spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic
   analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic
   analyses.}},

	Abstract = {{Background: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is
   to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate
   which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common
   practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the
   implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the
   haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of
   phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five
   non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular
   approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key
   issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of
   inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that
   drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting
   unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and
   the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses.
   Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e.,
   a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were
   incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with
   high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and
   genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were
   disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The
   standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream
   analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic
   diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with
   larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this
   causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic
   parameters.
   Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches
   for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications
   is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential
   impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic
   inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that
   enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles
   from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and
   effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.}},

	Abstract = {{To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient
   vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the
   Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly
   distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of
   fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja
   floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also
   examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales.
   Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing
   and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical
   signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six
   codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a
   scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago
   (Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting
   events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c.
   3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade
   phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based
   inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which
   phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong
   evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the
   Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region,
   however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly
   northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation
   of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and
   geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape

	Abstract = {{Pollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic
   variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen
   movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many
   herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and
   biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement
   in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations,
   located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic
   disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern
   Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently
   developed TWOGENER analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective
   number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size
   (A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each
   population. We extended the TWOGENER method by developing inference on
   the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where
   offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species
   with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal
   plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen
   movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the
   effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66)
   and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the
   disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen
   movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in
   disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects
   in Trillium habitats.}},

	Abstract = {{Anthropogenic landscape change can disrupt gene flow. As part of the
   Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, this study examined whether
   silvicultural practices influence pollen-mediated gene movement in the
   insect-pollinated species, Cornus florida L., by comparing pollen pool
   structure (Phi(st)) among clear-cutting, selective cutting, and uncut
   regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the
   uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings - 10 each from 150 seed
   parents (43 in clear-cut, 74 in selective, and 33 in control sites) from
   six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha), eight allozyme loci were
   analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as TWOGENER (Smouse
   et al., 2001; Evolution 55: 260-271). This analysis revealed that pollen
   pool structure was less in clear-cut ((Phi) over circle (C) = 0.090, P <
   0.001) than in uncut areas ((Phi) over cap (U) = 0.174, P < 0.001), with
   selective-cut intermediate ((Phi) over circles = 0.125, P < 0.001).
   These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N(ep)) in
   clear-cut (N(ep) = 5.56) and selective-cut (N(ep) = 4.00) areas than in
   uncut areas (N(ep) = 2.87). We demonstrate that Phi(C) less than or
   equal to Phi(S) less than or equal to Phi(U), with (Phi) over circle
   (C), significantly smaller than (Phi) over circle (U) (P < 0.034). The
   findings imply that, as long as a sufficiently large number of seed
   parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic
   bottleneck in the effective number of mothers, silvicultural management
   may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents, and
   hence subsequent genetic diversity in Cornus florida.}},

	Abstract = {{Patterns of intraspecific genetic variation result from interactions
   among both historical and contemporary evolutionary processes.
   Traditionally, population geneticists have used methods such as
   F-statistics, pairwise isolation by distance models, spatial
   autocorrelation and coalescent models to analyse this variation and to
   gain insight about causal evolutionary processes. Here we introduce a
   novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of
   marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework.
   This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic
   summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the
   complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic
   interactions among populations. We introduce the application of
   Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic
   structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this
   data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance,
   isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of
   specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by
   discussing the applicability of Population Graphs for addressing a wide
   range of population genetic and phylogeographical problems.}},

	Abstract = {{Patterns of pollen dispersal are central to both the ecology and
   evolution of plant populations. However, the mechanisms controlling
   either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process
   may be influenced by site-specific factors such as local forest
   structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here, we present an
   extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed TWOGENER
   analysis of pollen pool structure. This model, dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA
   (StAMOVA), focuses on determining to what extent ecological,
   demographic, and/or environmental factors influence the observed genetic
   variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified
   for efficacy, using an extensive battery of simulations, illustrating: (
   1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation
   of spatially separated pollen pools, and ( 2) how effectively the
   Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections.
   Finally, the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set, from which we
   have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly
   distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set, we show
   how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial
   adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast
   these results with those derived from the original TWOGENER analysis.}},

	Abstract = {{The fragmented populations and reduced population densities that result
   from human disturbance are issues of growing importance in evolutionary
   and conservation biology. A key issue is whether remnant individuals
   become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata )
   is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly
   jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied
   pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick
   Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen
   donors (N (ep) ) and average distance of effective pollen movement
   (delta). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of
   paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and
   progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N (ep) = 3.68
   individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we
   assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen
   dispersal distance (delta) and estimated delta= 64.8 m. We then deployed
   our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick
   population to evaluate the extent to which N (ep) may have changed, as a
   consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999.
   Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N
   (ep) was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both
   estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for
   wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results
   presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling
   pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic
   attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak
   resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic
   isolation.}},

	Abstract = {{While floral herbivores and predispersal seed predators often reduce
   plant reproductive output, their role in limiting plant fitness and
   population growth is less clear, especially for iteroparous perennial
   plant species. In this study we experimentally excluded floral
   herbivores and predispersal seed predators (insecticide spray versus
   water control) over a 2-year period to examine the effect of
   inflorescence-feeding insects on levels of seed production, seedling
   emergence, and juvenile establishment for Liatris cylindracea, an
   iteroparous perennial plant. In addition, we collected detailed
   demographic data on all life stage transitions for an additional set of
   individuals in the same population over 4 years. We used the
   experimental and demographic data to construct stochastic
   individual-based simulations to evaluate the overall effect of
   inflorescence-feeding insects on adult recruitment per maternal plant (a
   fitness component) and population growth rate. The insect exclusion
   experiments showed that damage due to insects decreased seed production,
   seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for both years'
   experiments. These results indicate that recruitment was seed-limited
   through juvenile establishment, and that inflorescence-feeding insects
   influenced the degree of seed limitation. Results of the
   individual-based simulation models, which included individual
   demographic and temporal stochasticity, showed that
   inflorescence-feeding insects negatively affected the number of adult
   offspring per maternal plant recruited into the population and
   population growth rate for both years' experiments. Taken together, the
   results of the experimental exclusions and the individual-based models
   indicate that inflorescence-feeding insects can influence population
   growth rate, and have the potential to act as a selective force for the
   evolution of traits in this plant species.}},

	Abstract = {{Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of
   genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system,
   which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and
   outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to
   the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest
   management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest
   management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem
   Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering
   dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant
   and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In
   1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida
   individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar
   to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management
   treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the
   management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study
   trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because
   differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental
   factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on
   a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the
   rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective
   number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the
   hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence
   on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among
   mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest
   treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single
   locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective
   number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management
   treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with
   local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local
   familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating
   was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show
   that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on
   insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could
   be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator
   behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on
   gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as
   management treatments are continued and further studies on additional
   plant species.}},

	Abstract = {{Pollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree
   species. Because pollen movement influences the creation, maintenance
   and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations, it is important
   to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement.
   Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly
   structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers.
   Extrinsic factors, such as the intervening vegetative structure and
   local pollen donor densities, can also influence the genetic composition
   of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast
   microsatellite markers, we examined the structure and diversity of
   pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri, USA. Our
   analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands
   (approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate
   to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen
   pool within regions (phi (SR) = 0.095), but not among regions (phi (RT)
   = 0.010), indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted.
   Furthermore, the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and
   physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho = 0.32) provided support for
   the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that
   availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen
   pool, measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each
   stand. However, pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with
   vegetative structure, measured as total forest tree density. Our
   findings indicated that on-going pollen movement within continuous
   forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by
   distance and vegetative structure.}},

	Abstract = {{Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially
   distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in
   microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in
   the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real
   time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation
   (parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener)
   that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools
   sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate
   mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we
   describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate
   intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine
   whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling
   considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by
   simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in
   male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT), a male gametic analogue of
   Wright's F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We
   illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically
   or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level
   of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous
   case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic
   resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus
   alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) = 0.06,
   translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an
   effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m.
   Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously
   realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This
   case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey
   and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about
   landscape-level gene movements.}},
